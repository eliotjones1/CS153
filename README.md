## README

This repository contains my work for Stanford's CS 153: Security at Scale course. \ 
The file 'AI_security_mitigations.md' contains all work that was written by myself, with citations included in the main file, 'cs153_final.pdf'. \
I would like to give credit to Donovan Jasper and Edward Adams for their respective sections of the paper (1 and 2).
